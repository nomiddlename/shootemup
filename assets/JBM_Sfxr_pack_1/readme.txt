Open source

 These sounds are released AS IS, but I've also included my own
SFXR files, so anyone who don't like a sound can tweak it around
as it pleases the users.

You need SFXR to edit any of the preset files:

You need any good audio editor such as Audacity to edit the 
sound files:

Show some appreciation folks.

 This pack has been in development for the last 2 years or so. If
you enjoy my hard work, then why not flattr jobromedia? Helps me
get convinced to continue to develop more sounds.

Thanks for downloading this package. Have fun!
